# Global Project Rules
- Maintain a clear separation between the /backend (Python) and /frontend (JavaScript) directories.
- Ensure all API contracts match between Python schemas and Frontend services.
- Always check for "dry" (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles across the stack.

# Python (Backend) Standards
- Use Type Hinting for all function signatures (e.g., `def get_user(id: int) -> User:`).
- Follow PEP8 style guidelines.
- Use structured logging instead of `print()` statements.
- Ensure all database sessions/connections are properly closed or used within context managers.
- Security: Sanitize all inputs and use Pydantic/Dataclasses for data validation.

# JavaScript/TypeScript (Frontend) Standards
- Prioritize functional components and Hooks (if using React).
- Ensure every API call has a `try/catch` block or a global error handler.
- Always include "Loading" and "Error" states for UI components fetching data.
- Use `const` by default; only use `let` if the variable must be reassigned.
- Security: Prevent XSS by avoiding `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless sanitized.

# AI Review Protocol
- When asked to "Review," prioritize finding logic bugs and type mismatches.
- Check if backend changes require a migration or environment variable update.
- Verify that frontend API calls match the actual Python route parameters.
